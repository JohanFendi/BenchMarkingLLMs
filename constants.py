TASK_DESCRIPTION = """

    You are a Haskell expert. Your task is to solve the following coding problem by writing a complete Haskell program.
    
    Requirements:
    - Implement a `main :: IO ()` that reads all input from stdin and writes the answer to stdout.
    - You may define as many helper functions as you need.
    - Only use Prelude functions — **do not** import any modules.
    - The code must compile under GHC and satisfy the problem specification.

    Respond with **only** valid Haskell code. **Do not** include comments, explanations, or markdown—just the standalone code. 
    Make sure not to get a parse error, so pay attention to the type of stdin. """
