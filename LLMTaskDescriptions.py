HASKELL_TASK_DESCRIPTION = """
    Your task is to solve the following problem by writing Haskell code.
    Requirements:
    1. Implement a `main :: IO ()` that reads all input from stdin and writes the answer to stdout.
    2. Your final solution should appear at the end of your response, with all code wrapped in a code 
        fence with the language tag Haskell. For example: ```Haskell main :: IO () -- implementation here ```. 
    3. Do not include comments or explanations â€” only raw code.
    4. You may **only** import these modules if needed: Data.List, Data.Char, Data.Map.Strict, Data.Set, Data.Array and Control.Monad. 
    5. When importing a module **you must only** list the specific functions you need in parentheses. For example: import Data.List (sort, nub). 
    6. Use only these Prelude I/O/parsing functions (no imports needed): getChar, getLine, getContents, interact, readLn, read, words and unwords. 
    7. Add explicit type signatures.
